# Machine-Learning-ClimateWins-python2
 This project is a continuation of the project you worked on in Achievement 1  'Machine-Learning-ClimateWins-python'.
 In this project,i will build on the skills i’ve learned by practicing them in various real-life situations. 
 we are working as a data analyst at a nonprofit organization called ClimateWins.
The following resources were consulted for this project: 
The European Climate Assessment and  Dataset website and the processed weather prediction dataset.

# Key Questions
 
 Identifying weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.
 Determining whether unusual weather patterns are increasing.
 Generating possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based
 on current trends.
 Determining the safest places for people to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years

# Finding

Applying PCA improved the clarity and interpretability of the dendrogram, while the Ward method remained the most effective for revealing meaningful weather patterns.

The CNN model reached 55% accuracy after hyperparameter tuning, showing moderate improvement but still struggling to classify all stations accurately.

Across experiments in Belgrade, Budapest, and Maastricht, precipitation and maximum temperature emerged as the most influential features in the Random Forest model for predicting pleasant weather — likely due to their strong impact on human comfort.

While GANs are primarily designed to generate synthetic data, they may offer creative potential for simulating future weather scenarios or augmenting sparse datasets.
